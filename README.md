# camera-control-software
Software that uses gphoto2 library to communicate with DSLR camera. !Linux only.!

gui.py contains code for GUI that is able to control a camera. CameraControl.py defines class that uses gphoto2 command line commands to communicate with camera. 

!After changing the modes of the camera or selecting new camera, GUI tends to freeze. Process of changing mod and detecting camera is long so be patient :)

!Live view is operating like continuous imaging, thus frame rate is slow. This section is still buggy. 

Software still in development.
